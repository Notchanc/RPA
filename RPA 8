Aim: PDF automation and exception handling 

1. Read Pdf with OCR.

Steps:

1. Open UiPath Studio and create a new process.
2. Drag and drop the Read PDF with OCR activity into the workflow.
3. In the File Name property, provide the path of the PDF file (e.g., "C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Offer Letter.pdf").
4. Select Tesseract OCR as the OCR engine to extract text.
5. Create a variable (e.g., scrap_data) to store the extracted text.
6. After the OCR activity, add a Message Box activity.
7. In the Text property of the Message Box, write scrap_data.ToString.
8. Run the workflow: UIPath will read the PDF file using OCR and display the extracted text in a message box.

Conclusion: Thus we have studied to demonstrate Read Pdf with OCR Activity in UiPath

1. Demonstrate Exception Handling Using UiPath

Steps:

1. Open UiPath Studio and create a new process.
2. Create a variable named "Array" of type Int32[] and assign default value {10, 20}.
3. Create another variable named "i" of type Int32 and assign default value -1.
4. Drag and drop a Sequence activity into the workflow.
5. Insert a Try Catch activity inside the sequence.
6. In the Try block, add a Message Box with text Array(i).ToString.
7. In the Catch block, set exception type as: System.IndexOutOfRangeException.
8. Add a Message Box in the Catch block with text: Exception.ToString.
9. In the Finally block, add a Message Box with text "Exception Handled".
10. Run the workflow to see exception handling execution.

Conclusion: Thus we have studied to demonstrate Exception Handling Using UiPath.
