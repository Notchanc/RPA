Aim: Excel Automation

4A) Automate the process to extract data from an excel file into a data table and vice versa Create a new Sequence in your Main workflow.

1. Drag a Use Excel File activity and set the path to input.xlsx.
2. Inside it, add a Read Range activity and save the output to a variable dtData.
3. Drag another Use Excel File activity and set the path to output.xlsx.
4. Inside it, add a Write Range activity and pass dtData as the DataTable input.
5. Set the target sheet name (e.g., "Sheet1") and tick the Add Headers option.
6. Run the workflow to read data from input.xlsx and write it to output.xlsx.

Conclusion: Thus we have studied how to automate the process to extract data from an excel file into a data table and vice versa Create a new Sequence in your Main workflow.

4B Create an automation To Write data to specific cell of an excel sheet.

1. Drag Use Excel File activity and select the Excel file path (testing.xlsx).
2. Inside it, add a Write Cell activity.
3. Set What to Write as "College".
4. Set Where to Write as Excel.Sheet("SheetName").Cell("H4") or Excel.SelectedSheet.Cell("H4").
5. Run the workflow to write "College" into cell H4 in Excel.

Conclusion: Thus we have studied how to create an automation To Write data to specific cell of an excel sheet.

4C] Create an automation To Read data to specific cell of an excel sheet.

1. Drag and drop a Use Excel File activity and choose your Excel file.
2. Inside it, add a Read Cell activity.
3. Set Cell to read as Excel.Sheet("SheetName")/Cell("A2") or Excel.SelectedSheet.Cell("A8").
4. Assign the output to a variable (e.g., cellValue).
5. (Optional) Use a Message Box or Write Line to display cellValue.

Conclusion: Thus we have studied how to create an automation To Read data to specific cell of an excel sheet.

4D) Create an automation To append data to specific cell of an excel sheet.

1. Use "Excel Application Scope" – Open the target Excel file by providing its path.
2. Inside the scope, add "Write Cell" activity – This will allow writing directly to a specific cell.
3. Set "SheetName" in Write Cell – Enter the name of the worksheet (e.g., "Sheet1").
4. Set "Cell" property – Provide the cell address where you want to append data (e.g., "C5").
5. Set "Value" property – Type the data or use a variable to write into that specific cell.
6. Save and run the workflow – This will append/write the data to the desired cell in Excel.

Conclusion: Thus we have studied how create an automation To append data to specific cell of an excel sheet.

4E) Create an automation To sort a table of an excel sheet.

1. Use "Excel Application Scope" – Open the Excel file containing the table to be sorted.
2. Use "Sort Table" activity – Drag this inside the scope to perform sorting.
3. Set "SheetName" – Enter the worksheet name (e.g., "Sheet1").
4. Set "Table Name" – Provide the exact table name (e.g., "Table1").
5. Configure "Sort Fields" – Add column names and sort order (e.g., {"Rollno", "Ascending"}).
6. Run the automation – The table will be sorted as per your settings.

Conclusion: Thus we have studied how to create an automation To sort a table of an excel sheet.

4F] Create an automation To filter a table of an excel sheet.

1. Use Use Excel File and select your Excel file.
2. Inside it, add Filter Excel activity.
3. Set the Source (e.g. Excel.Sheet("Sheet1")).
4. Filter By, choose the Column Name (e.g. "Location").
5. Set the Filter Condition (e.g. equals "Pen").

Conclusion: Thus we have studied how to create an automation To filter a table of an excel sheet.
